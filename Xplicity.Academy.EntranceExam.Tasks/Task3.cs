    //Task #3 (Points: 40)
    //An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word using all the original letters exactly once.
    //For example, “elbow” - “below”. Calculate a number of anagram pairs in the specified text.
    //Each anagram pair should be counted only once, therefore for the text “My elbow was below” expected result is 1,
    //however for the text “My elbow was below, below another elbow” expected result is 2 (2 pairs)
    //The input text is not-nullable string of English letters, digits 0-9 and punctuation symbols.
    //The output data is an integer representing the amount of pairs.
